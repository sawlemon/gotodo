# GOTODO

This repo will contain a CLI TODO app using Go Language.

# Expected Behaviour

Once the output binary is executed running ./gotodo should enter a prompt mode

### Prompts:

/add <task> - Add tasks to the list

/ls - list all the tasks

/del <number> - Delete the task

/bye - Quit the program
